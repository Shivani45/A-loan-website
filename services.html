              </ul>
              <h3>So if you are planning to avail a home loan, here are some tips:</h3>
                <p>Firstly, take your own time and evaluate your expenses and do a market survey about the property buying process. Buying a house, which is way beyond your range, could affect you financially; banks help in financing your dream home via home loans.</p>
                <p>Eligibility<br/>
                Banks determine your eligibility based on your repayment capacity and discuss about the loan amount up front. The eligibility for acquiring a home loan is augmented by clubbing income of your father/spouse/mother/son, by clearing your outstanding debts, by stretching your loan tenure, Salaried individuals can increase their eligibility by showing their performance linked income or bonus earned.
                Secondly, Do your own analysis and check the impact of your repayment of home loan on your monthly expenditure, as a thumb rule, it's recommended to make sure the EMI of your home loan do not exceed more than 40% of your gross monthly income.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interest rates best suited<br/1>
An important factor that goes into your EMI calculations is the interest rates, which may vary from bank to bank, so do compare them. Also do a complete and detailed analysis of the various options like the interest rates i.e. fixed and floating rate of interest.
Thirdly, if two banks give you the same amount of loan but at different interest rates do your math and work out what's best for you.
                
Fixed interest loans charge an interest, which remains the same through out the tenure of the loan. This means that the consumer is immune to market risk or the possible upward movement in the interest rates.
Hence, fixed rate is a good option when the home loan interest rates are expected to move up in the future.</br>

As for floating rate loan, a consumer is exposed to market risk and his gain or loss depends on the interest rate condition prevailing in the market. Floating rate is beneficial if the interest rate falls in the future. A floating rate is considered non-transparent and is also known as 'adjustable rate'.
                </br>
Fourthly, if you decide to opt for a fixed rate loan, you can still switch to a floating rate loan in the future and vice versa as and when rates go in your favour and if you do decide to switch, you should take into account the cost of doing so and the home loan rate benefits of switching.
            </br>
For a given interest rate, loan with a daily or monthly reducing balance is better than an annual reducing balance loan. Interest rates vary depending on the tenure of the loan, the amount of the loan and your personal profile.
        </br>
Insurance cover (an added cost) Also, many banks may insist on getting your home insured to safeguard their interest. There are various kinds of insurance covers available for you. Apart from getting the mandatory ones you should try to get insurance as per your circumstances. You also have a choice of getting insured from another company without any objection from your bank.</p>
            
            <h2><img src="personal.png"/>Personal Loan</h2>

                Personal loan is the obvious choice if you need a finance for Personal finance, Medical emergency, Wedding purposes, Abroad travel, Holidays, Child education and for buying consumer durable things. Means if you have a requirement of money so personal loan is the best choice.
